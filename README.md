# simple-interest-calculator
A simple script/tool to calculate the interest earned or paid over a period of time.

## Description
This project provides a straightforward way to calculate simple interest based on the principal amount, the annual interest rate, and the time period in years.

## Formula
The calculation is based on the standard simple interest formula:

$I = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$

Where:
* **P** = Principal amount
* **R** = Annual interest rate (in percentage)
* **T** = Time (in years)

## Usage
1. Input the Principal amount.
2. Input the annual Rate of interest.
3. Input the Time period in years.
4. The output will be the total Interest earned.
